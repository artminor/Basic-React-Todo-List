      <p>This is the TodoList app v.1.0.0</p>
      < p > Why ? </p> 
      < p > Because multitasking isn 't real even if we consistently claim we are able to, 
                  we end up doing a mediocre job of everything when we take on too much.
                  The barrage of social media, e - mails, miscellaneous obligations keep us from getting our work done.
                  We are overwhelmed and burdened by simultaneous demands and distractions, yet we still want to do more... </p>
        <p> OneNow will help us accomplish more by doing work in smaller chucks;
                  focusing on one task at a time.
                  It is a powerful to - do task management tool with awareness
                      for
                      a healthier work - style.
                  OneNow keeps track of your tasks but will only remind you of your current single - task responsibility,
                      while monitoring and reminding you of everything you 've accomplished when needed.
                  The sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to do more,
                      and will help you stay focused.Stop getting distracted, become motivated and by only doing OneNow! </p>
